# XG8800 Arduino with WiFi / 3G / BLE &amp; LCD

The XG8800 is a standalone wireless LCD display with touchscreen, compatible with all wireless standards, and easily programmable with Arduino or Particle sketches. It allows you to monitor and/or control remote hardware. Use the Grove connectors to add any kind of I/O interface without the need for soldering.

The XG8800 combines a WiFi, BLE or 3G Arduino CPU board with a 9.0" our 5.0" 800x480 or 2.4" 240x320 TFT LCD with touchscreen.

It's compatible with popular wireless Arduino and Particle CPU boards: Arduino MKR1000, Redbear Duo, Redbear BLE Nano, Particle Proton and Particle Electron.

You can add up to 6 Grove expansion modules. There is also an SDCard socket to store all fonts and images required to build a nice looking graphic user interface for your projects.

The USB connector can be used to power the module. A power input Grove connector or a compact AC/DC plug-in module(100V to 240V) is also available.

Easily programmable with the Arduino IDE or Particle IDE.

The 9.0" high resolution LCD allows you to make stunning looking wireless Arduino tablet-size projects. The medium sized 5.0" LCD is perfect for your wireless Arduino project requiring a smartphone-sized LCD. Finally the 2.4" LCD is perfect for those projects which just require a compact LCD.
